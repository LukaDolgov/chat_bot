This is a chatbot using a Transformer model trained on Shakespeare's writing. I use Byte-Pair Encoding to tokenize language and feed into the model.

A special thank you to Kenneth Wilber (kawgit) for assisting me greatly on this project, and giving me many key insights into not only the model, but how to program in a more clean and efficient way.
